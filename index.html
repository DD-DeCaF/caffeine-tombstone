      <p>Dear visitor,</p>

      <p>
        Are you looking for Caffeine, the SaaS platform for data- and
        model-driven strain engineering? Unfortunately, Caffeine reached its end
        of life around August 2023 ðŸ˜­. Below, you can find a screen recording of
        some of the strain design and data integration capabilities that
        Caffeine featured.
      </p>

        After the funding from the European Union (Horizon 2020) ended in 2019
        (which financed its development and deployment from 2016 to 2019 as part
        of the
        <a href="https://dd-decaf.eu/">DD-DeCaF project</a>) and parts of the
        development team moved on to co-founding a
        <a href="https://unseen.bio/"
          >startup in the gut microbiome health area</a
        >, I kept the lights on for a few more years (which had been easy due to
        the great job the development team had done on the platform) with the
        <a href="https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/"
          >Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability</a
        >
        kindly covering the hosting costs. It served about 75 unique monthly
        users.

        Around August 2023, Google Cloud unfortunately deprecated some APIs that
        would have required some more serious work on the source code. At the
        time, I did not have the capacity to tackle the required changes myself.
        So, I had to take the platform down.
      </p>

        If you like what you see in the video, all
        <a href="https://github.com/dd-decaf">source code</a> is open source and
        licensed permissively using the Apache License Version 2.0. Feel free to
        contact me if you'd be interested in resurrecting the platform, I'd be
        happy to provide pointers. This
        <a href="https://github.com/DD-DeCaF/caffeine-bootstrap">repository</a>
        would be a good starting point as it provides the means for deploying
        the platform locally (it suffers from a number of dependency issues
        though that need to be resolved).
      </p>

      <p>Sincerest apologies for any inconvenience caused,</p>
